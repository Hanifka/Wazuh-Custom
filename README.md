Wazuh Custom

This repository contains all custom Python scripts I’ve developed to extend, automate, and enhance Wazuh operations.
Each script is designed to solve real-world use cases in threat detection, log analysis, and automation for Wazuh environments.


📁 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several main directories, each serving a distinct purpose in Wazuh customization:

agent/scripts/ – Contains Python scripts designed to run on Wazuh agents, primarily for Active Response automation.

manager/integration/ – Includes integration scripts that connect Wazuh with other systems or extend its core capabilities.

manager/automation/ – Focused on automating Wazuh manager-side tasks such as rule updates, data synchronization, or report generation.

utils/parsers/ – Provides helper utilities, custom decoders, and log parsers used to preprocess or normalize data before analysis.

README.md – Overview and documentation for all custom Wazuh-related scripts in this repository.

🧠 About

This repository is part of my continuous learning and contribution to the Wazuh open-source ecosystem.
All scripts here are built, tested, and shared with the goal of helping the community enhance detection and automation.
